This is the source code I adapted for my convenience based on the Tutorial by IBM "Develop Spring Redis applications". Here you can access the tutorial: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/os-springredis/index.html

It's just an eclipse project with his Maven dependencies and the source code commented for learning purposes. It's very recommended to read the tutorial to see the guidelines and purpose of the project, but anyway I'll make some brief comments on installing and running it.

1.- Required software

	- Eclipse (well, you know that's not required, but the project was made in Eclipse, so it definitely simplifies things :-)
	- RedisDB (you can download it here: http://redis.io/ ). I don't really know if it can run under a Windows OS, so...
	- ...a UNIX based OS (?)
	- Java (at least 6)
	- Maven 
	- You

2.- Configuration

	The demo runs under the default configuration of a fresh installation of RedisDB (that's the reason why you won't see any database file configuration)

3.- Running the demo


	To run the demo you just have to run the JUnit tests of the class "DictionaryDaoTest". You'll obviously want to change and add things to research and proves, so feel free to add, change or remove whatever you want!
